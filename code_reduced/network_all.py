"""
This code trains a neural network with either tanh or relu activation function. The outputs of each layer are stored.
The layer outputs get discretized using an equal width binning method with either fixed or adapted bounds defining the range.
Finally, the mutual information is esttimated for the binned layer outputs and the input data, as well as the target label√∂s and plotted iin an information plane plot.
